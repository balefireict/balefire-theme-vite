DEV PREREQUISITES ----------------------------------------------

1) This Theme is setup for Vite and Laravel Herd 
	- This is for offline, local development
	- make sure the server is setup to run PHP 7
2) I recommend Sublime Text 3 as a code editor
3) I recommend FileZilla as an FTP client

LOCAL DEV SETUP ----------------------------------------------

1) Download WordPress into a project folder
2) Add Base theme to theme folder, remove stock themes
3) Download and Unzip WordPress into the Herd Folder, name it your project name, and it will automatically have the project-name.test for the domain
4) In phpMyAdmin, create a database, user, and connect user to the database
	- db = utf8_unicode_ci
	- user = grant all privileges
	- Go ahead and create the database and user on the staging/live server with matching credentials
5) Rename WordPress' "wp-config-sample.php" to "wp-config.php"
6) Fill in database, user, password, and salts
7) Change the default "wp_" database prefix to something unique
8) Open project in a browser (http://clientdomain.test) and install WordPress
9) Activate theme and core plugins
